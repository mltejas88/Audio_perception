# Audio_perception
Audio perception for robotics. This is an example project where audio command received by a source is recorded, analyzed (Speech-To-Text conversion), intent is extracted from the text and command is given to the robot.
You can use this as a template to future develop the logic as per your requirement to implement in Raspberry Pi , Nvidia Jetson GPU etc.,
